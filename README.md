# Flask Login Example - Realpython

This repo is the complete code for the [RealPython Flask Google Login](https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/) tutorial. I couldn't find a repo with all the code, so followed the instructions and copied the code for testing. And it works brilliantly. 

The only extra endpoint I added is "/testpage" to test the login_required decorator. 

Thanks [Alexander VanTol](https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/) for the great article.
